      <description>Sometimes, you just run out of time.
This was my second loaf with Community Grains flour. Like the first, a complet baked using more typical time and temperature, it came out great. In fact, its balance of wheat and sour flavors remains unique among my loaves. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t always seem that promising.

  First, though the flour was great, I started late and ran into bed time.</description>

      <description>In late 2013, I made my first loaf with hard red winter wheat flour from Community Grains. This stuff, which is milled at Certified Foods in Woodland, CA and marketed out of Oakland, is amazing.
I still remember the strength of the wheaty smell after mixing up the dough. It blew typical whole wheat flour out of the water. Some of this difference must owe to its freshness, but apparently some might owe to the milling process.</description>
