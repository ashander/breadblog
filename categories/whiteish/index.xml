      <description>You can tell a good crust by the way it crackles.
I mixed up this mostly-white loaf in the evening, and let it ferment overnight. By the morning, when I stretched and folded it a few times the dough felt pillowy but not too sticky. And during its long proof, it began to peek out from the top of the banneton.
All that airiness led to a great bloom, and the high-volume loaf had a wonderful open crumb.</description>
