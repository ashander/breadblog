title: ten grain porridge soaker
image: "porridge-final.jpg"
categories: ["multi-grain", "loaf", "soaker"]
ingredients: ["banneton", "white flour", "10 grain"]
stuff:
  soaker:
    water: [300g, boiling hot]
    ten-grain hot cereal: [200g, (Bob's Red Mill)]
  dough:
    barm: [100g, fed 1.5 days in fridge]
    flour: [300g, (King Arthur All Purpose White)]
    water: [300g, water, 100°F]
    salt: [10g]
stats:
  bulk: 8 hours, 80°F temp
  proof: 0.5 hours
  bake: 30 lid on, 20 lid off
  temp: 205
steps:
  bulk: Began bulk fermentation at 90F°; after 8 hours the dough was soupy. It might have held its form better a few hours earlier.
  proof: I quickly formed the dough on a thick layer of flour and proofed 30 minutes in a banneton
  bake: |
    Scooping the loaf into a cast iron dutch oven, I sprinkled on some cornmeal and roughly slashed the top.
    It baked for 20 minutes with the lid on at 500°F, and 30 (!) minutes with the lid off at 450°F.
    Out of the oven, the loaf registered 205°F in the center.

Using a _soaker_---some raw or ground grain mixed in water, soaked for a bit, then added to the dough after the first mix---you can put almost any grain into a sourdough loaf.
For this loaf, I used some Bob's Red Mill 10 grain hot cereal (good cereal, by the way):

> whole wheat, rye, triticale, millet, oats, brown rice, barley, corn, soy beans, oat bran and flaxseeds

I've made a few loaves using this technique.
More often than not, they've ended up with very high hydration (this one pencils out to something like 120% water, which was too much) but a chewy and highly gelatinized crumb.
They make great toast.
