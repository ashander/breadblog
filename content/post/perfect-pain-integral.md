The bread below is the "holy grail". It was delicious, so I hope it's not too fleeting.

# Recipe

* 100g barm (fed three days prior and kept in fridge)
* 425g water
* 500g whole wheat community grains flour (Bob's Red Mill)
* 10g salt

Mixed up, it registered 70째F. After stretching and folding occasionally for about 12 hours (in a room temperature oven), I formed a loaf and proofed for just over 1 hour.

Baking: 20 minutes lid-on in a cast iron dutch oven, pre-heated in a 500째F oven; then lid  off, down to 450째F and 15 minutes more.
The final loaf registered 200째F in the center

The crust is not very crunchy (compared to pain complet with at least 25% white flour) but the intense caramel wheat flavor makes up for it.
