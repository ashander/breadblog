The bread below is the "holy grail". It was delicious, so I hope it's not too fleeting.

{{< ingredients >}}

Mixed up, it registered 70°F. After stretching and folding occasionally for about 12 hours (in a room temperature oven), I formed a loaf and proofed for just over 1 hour.

Baking: 20 minutes lid-on in a cast iron dutch oven, pre-heated in a 500°F oven; then lid  off, down to 450°F and 15 minutes more.
The final loaf registered 200°F in the center

The crust is not very crunchy (compared to pain complet with at least 25% white flour) but the intense caramel wheat flavor makes up for it.
