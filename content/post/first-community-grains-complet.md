In late 2013, I made my first loaf with hard red winter wheat flour from Community Grains.
This stuff, which is milled at Certified Foods in Woodland, CA and [marketed out of Oakland](https://www.communitygrains.com/), is amazing.


I still remember the strength of the wheaty smell after mixing up the dough.
It blew typical whole wheat flour out of the water.
Some of this difference must owe to its freshness, but apparently some might owe to the milling process.
Community Grains mills "true" whole wheat flour---where a bunch of whole wheat berries come in, are ground up, and then you have flour.
In contrast, larger mills first split the wheat berry into its parts (bran, endosperm, germ), grind these and then recombine them in various proportion in their flours.

After several stretch and folds during an approximately 4 hour bulk fermentation.
Then, 2 hours proof in banneton at 70°F.
Finally, bake in cast iron:
