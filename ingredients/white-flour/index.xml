      <description>Using a soaker&amp;mdash;some raw or ground grain mixed in water, soaked for a bit, then added to the dough after the first mix&amp;mdash;you can put almost any grain into a sourdough loaf. For this loaf, I used some Bob&amp;rsquo;s Red Mill 10 grain hot cereal (good cereal, by the way):
 whole wheat, rye, triticale, millet, oats, brown rice, barley, corn, soy beans, oat bran and flaxseeds
 I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few loaves using this technique.</description>

      <description>You can tell a good crust by the way it crackles.
I mixed up this mostly-white loaf in the evening, and let it ferment overnight. By the morning, when I stretched and folded it a few times the dough felt pillowy but not too sticky. And during its long proof, it began to peek out from the top of the banneton.
All that airiness led to a great bloom, and the high-volume loaf had a wonderful open crumb.</description>
